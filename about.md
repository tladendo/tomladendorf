About me
========

My name is Tom Ladendorf. I am a musician, programmer, and student living in
Bloomington, Indiana. I am currently pursuing my BA in Computer Science and
Hisotry, which I will finish in December of 2013.

On this site, you can find my technology blog, as well as links to a number of
my other projects. If you would like to contact me, email me at
