&nbsp;&nbsp; For me, the key feature of great music is songfulness. In music, the most important thing should always be conveying the song: the idea, the mood, the groove. Everything else is secondary.

&nbsp;&nbsp; By this I mean that I don't listen to music to hear something done well. I don't listen to music to hear skilled playing, interesting harmonies, or creative ideas. All of these by themselves are worthless if they're not supporting something bigger. A musical scale played at breakneck speed is mind-numbingly boring, as are imaginative, byzantine chord combinations. Even melody, on its own, doesn't count for much. After all, who could stand to listen (for long) to midi performances of their favorite melodies? And by the same token, who would want to listen to the Ramones without their perfectly-predictable-but-still-perfect I-IV-V chord progressions?

&nbsp;&nbsp; The formal features of music can certainly play important roles within a song, but they are all completely secondary to great songsmanship. A great song doesn't need to have any one element to be great—not even melody, harmony, or rhythm. It just needs to be successful in telling a story, in conveying a feeling to the listener. A great drumbeat, without melody or harmony, can make us want to get up and dance; and a single voice can carry as much emotional weight as a whole ensemble. Even musique concrète, which consists entirely of found sounds from the outside world, can capture a mood and draw us in without employing any of the formal elements of what we normally think of as music.

&nbsp;&nbsp; We know this intuitively, but we mostly all we teach of music are these totally nonessential formal features. When I was in band class in high school, we learned all this and played good music, too, but it almost seemed to arise by a sort of calculus. Gradual crescendo here, correct articulation there—pretty soon, you've got a real performance. Even though we learned in terms of building blocks, it seemed like we never got beyond the details and into what music actually makes us feel. It makes sense to me that for most of my classmates, there was a serious disconnect between what they played on their instruments and what they listened to of their own free will.

&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm lucky that I was able to bridge this gap by taking up songwriting at a young age. Looking back, I started back in a pretty sad state, churning out stale 3-chord punk songs with lyrics that could only have been drawn from the life experience of a 13-year-old. But as I grew from this point, my music gradually became something meaningful to me and something that I could express myself with. Songwriting taught me to really appreciate the song as the fundamental unit of music, the sine qua non of the artform.

&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish that, in addition to teaching music as a technical practice, schools could somehow open this world for students, that we could have the sort of culture of song that seems to be embodied by folk traditions. In addition to learning scales and other patterns, we should be learning to what we feel into our instruments and create something that we can have fun with. This, after all, is what really counts. John Coltrane understood this. Even though he was a technical master of the tenor saxophone who put in 13-hour days, he played, above all, with feeling. Perhaps it's not important that we each play with Coltrane's sense of mystic religious conviction, but I think we would still do well to heed his aphorism that “You can play a shoestring if you're sincere.
