 &nbsp;&nbsp; Last week was a sad and violent week in America. I was extremely troubled both by the killings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, as well as by the shooting of 5 police officers in Dallas. It took me a while to process what happened, but I've managed to put together a few thoughts on the subject.

	 &nbsp;&nbsp; All of last weeks' killings were tragic. The killings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile strike me with a combination of horror and a sense of tragic predictability. The murder of 5 police officers in Dallas was senseless and disgusting. I feel very firmly that violence will not be the answer to transforming the violent reality we're confronted with, and these killings all underscored this point. Because of this, and because 7 individual and valuable human lives were lost, it's vital for us to commemorate and understand these deaths.
  
	 &nbsp;&nbsp; Because it often goes unappreciated, I also want to note that #BlackLivesMatter is a nonviolent movement that has condemned the actions of the Dallas shooter, whose actions were hateful and horrible, but privately undertaken. BLM nonetheless makes a lot of white people uncomfortable, and even more so now. Some people are quick to suggest that BLM is responsible for fomenting anti-police violence, or that anti-brutality protests have contributed to a “Ferguson effect” that has seen an increase in street violence due to greater restraint in policing. For these folks, I have a quick note.

	 &nbsp;&nbsp; White people have always been uncomfortable with militant black folks, whether or not they're violent. Martin Luther King, Jr., who now sits so comfortably in the canon of Great People, drew plenty of condemnation from white folks. He also called the white moderate the “great stumbling block” in the black freedom struggle. The white moderate was indeed and continues to be the great obstacle to racial equality in America.

	 &nbsp;&nbsp; This is because white people don't like (meaningfully) questioning the white supremacist hierarchy of which they've been the primary beneficiaries. It's white people who sit firmly at the top of a racially-coded economic pyramid that was built upon that now rock-solid foundations of black slavery and violent appropriation of indigenous lands. As we've moved into the contemporary era, it's white people who have fought to keep both of these groups in marginal positions. Even at the same time that there have been huge strides forward in civil rights, there are gigantic racial gaps (economic, educational, criminal) that are an obvious result of our long legacy of white supremacist violence. Questioning this legacy and looking at its fruits means white people might have to give up something to address these wrongs—which they are clearly not wont to do.

	 &nbsp;&nbsp; Folks who criticize #BlackLivesMatter, especially white people, need to recognize all this, and check themselves when they turn a blind eye to white supremacy. By all means, mourn the slain officers and condemn the violence that led to their deaths. But grieve, too, for Alton Sterling and Philando Castile and condemn anti-black violence. To not engage with white supremacy is to let it continue on the violent course it's taken—which is exactly what's led us to our fractious and violent reality.
