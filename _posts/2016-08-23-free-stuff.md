&nbsp;&nbsp; The story is familiar: conservatives claim that liberals want “free stuff” paid for with other people's money, while liberals argue that that's not what public programs are about. We've all heard liberal arts students caricatured for studying “useless” subjects and then going on to leech off society while working at a coffeehouse (people seem to reserve a special vitriol for a modern version of this stereotype, the “hipster on food stamps buying organic chicken”). Typically, we must then acknowledge that middle-class impropriety happens, then try to find a way around it, and show that it's not important.

&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to respond by making the point that welfare abusers (or rather, “abusers”) were only a minority of recipients, and that we should focus instead on the much more disastrous consequences of how the rich are gaming the system. Regardless of the excesses of welfare recipients—food stamps are less than 3% of the total federal budget—the costs that the rich place on society are much greater: the IRS estimates that tax evasion costs us around half a trillion in tax receipts. And even if you were to totally set aside tax evasion, you'd be hard pressed to find any time in recent memory that the decisions of the poor damaged this country as much as, say, the 2008 financial crisis (to say nothing of what that crisis has done to the rest of the world).

&nbsp;&nbsp; One could, of course, carry this critique of the dangerous excesses of the rich further, perhaps by discussing the Iraq War and the subsequent rise of ISIS, or the negligent poisoning of the people of Flint, Michigan, or the abandonment of the industrial working class of the Rust Belt in favor of overseas production. Without question, the decisions of the rich have time and again brought immense death and destruction upon (poor) Americans and citizens of the Third World. Meanwhile, the poor don't get anywhere near causing this level of damage, even when they engage in violence (compare inner-city riots of recent years to, say, the bombing of Iraq).

&nbsp;&nbsp; But I think this would actually be conceding too much. That is, perhaps we shouldn't throw the hipster on food stamps under the bus. Why give up the battle over free stuff so soon?

&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll be upfront here and admit that I want free stuff. I want free healthcare, housing, and food, and I think that additional material comfort should be available to me in the form of guaranteed work. In general, I find the idea of not having to work for a living quite nice. It's 2016, and I'm not ashamed to say that I think I deserve nice things just for being born.

&nbsp;&nbsp; I know I sound the picture of an entitled millenial, but I think I'm perfectly in the right to be entitled. You see, over the past forty years, the economy has continued to grow as a result of the contributions of workers, innovative thinkers, and entrepreneurs. But unfortunately, the lion's share of this wealth generation has been annexed to the wealthy, in an apparent recognition of their esteemed virtue of already having money.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally, I find this grotesque and illegitimate. While we needed people to invest in the economy for it to grow, it's not investors who did the real work of building the world we live in today. Instead of going overwhelmingly to the rich, all that new wealth and income we generated should've been distributed either evenly or progressively. We should abhor the fact that, in the last 40 years, a yawning wealth gap has grown wider and wider while millions of Americans went without healthcare, safe neighborhoods, decent schools, and apparently even without clean water.

&nbsp;&nbsp; These gains in productivity could've been shared in several ways: my parents' generation could've been paid higher wages, our public institutions (schools, public transit, environmental management) could have been better funded, or our public programs could have been expanded. If we want to make things right going forward, it'll probably be easier to focus on the latter two, and make sure they benefit my parents' generation as well as myself. No matter how you slice it, though, it'll seem like free stuff: higher wages without more work, more and better public services without greater costs to the median taxpayer, and expanded access to programs like social security.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is exactly what the wealthy have been getting during the past forty years: more and more money without any additional effort (though, in their case, it was apparently without any general contribution to the common good: the median wage in the US has stagnated during this period). So yeah, I want free stuff, but I'm not the only one who wants to be rewarded for doing nothing. I just want to flip the distribution of free stuff: instead of going to a tiny minority of the population, the free stuff we generate should be going to everyone.
